I'm using Github Pages to host a mock website for the Daintree E-Reader, an imaginary competitor to the Amazon Kindle. Through this project, I practiced my technical writing skills and also learned a great deal about website development (mostly that there is absolutely so much I don't know).

For this small website, I used HTML, CSS, and a bit of Javascript. The Javascript comes directly from a W3School.com tutorial: https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_accordion.asp), so I do not claim to take credit for that Javascript code. I also used W3Schools tutorials and reference guides intensively throughout the creation of this site.
